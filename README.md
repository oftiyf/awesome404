# ERC404 Implementation

This is an implementation of the ERC404 standard, which combines features of ERC20 and ERC721 tokens.

## Known Issues and Limitations

### 1. Lack of Randomness
- Currently, the protocol does not implement any random number generation mechanism
- NFT IDs are assigned sequentially using a deterministic approach
- This could lead to predictable outcomes in:
  - NFT minting sequences
  - Token distribution patterns
  - Recovery of specific NFT IDs

### 2. Gas Optimization Issues
- The current implementation has suboptimal search algorithms
- High gas consumption in several key operations:
  - Linear search through stored NFT IDs
  - Inefficient iteration when recovering multiple NFTs
  - Repeated array operations in token transfers
- These inefficiencies particularly impact:
  - Large-scale token transfers
  - NFT recovery operations
  - Batch processing of tokens

## Future Improvements
1. Implement a secure random number generation mechanism
2. Optimize search algorithms using more efficient data structures
3. Reduce gas costs through better storage management
4. Implement batch processing optimizations
